# SRS-GDA_Toolbox
SRS-GDA toolbox is motivated by and aimed at quantification on hydro-climatic responses driven by grid-based forcing datasets such as climate model projections, varying with locations and regions and scales.   The toolbox can be used to grid map into different resolution(1km, 5km and 10km) and do random spatial sampling of grid-based quantities with various constraints: shape, size, location and dominant orientation.  More details can be found in the paper "SRS-GDA: A Spatial Random Sampling Toolbox for Grid-based Hydro-climatic Data Analysis in Environmental Change Studies" written by Han Wang and Yunqing Xuan
